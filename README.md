# Casement
A popup-oriented engine for making adventure games in Twine.

This is a work-in-progress engine designed to create adventure games in Twine. It is built on top of the Sugar Cube story format (v. 2.30.0). Casement currently implements stackable popup windows, a standard inventory, a dedicated inventory window, text reactive to popups being viewed, and a simple conversation window and system. Possible future systems could include a character system and an action section/popup.
